Slime Survival
============

In this project, I developed a 2D survival game where enemies spawn in waves, and the player's goal is to survive for as long as possible.  
This project was part of my Game Development minor, which is a program jointly offered by Bezalel Academy of Art and Design and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
